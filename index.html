            <h3>SEO Deep-Dive | Python, Tableau</h3>
            <p>My client wanted to identify profitable opportunities to target improved SEO rankings. I analysed rank, search volume and competitiveness of search terms, prioritised by profitability for the company, and identified substantial niche areas for the client to focus their SEO strategy on. I used Python to clean my data and build the database, and Tableau to build custom, relevant visuals to aid in explanations to non-technical and non-marketing stakeholders. <a href="https://link-to-live-project.com">Live Demo</a> | <a href="seo_deep_dive/index.html">View Project</a></p>

            <h3>Eurovision Trends | SQL, Python, Tableau (in-progress)</h3>
            <p>I started nerding-out over the history and influences of Eurovision results and wanted to see if I could build some cool visualisations of trends or even predictions of what factors contribute to placing in the top 5 overall positions. I was particularly interested in the relationship (if any) between the professional jury vs general population scores. I used SQL and Python for data management and querying and Tableau to build the visual story. <a href="https://link-to-live-project.com">Live Demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/your-repo/project-2">GitHub Repo</a></p>

            <h3>Servicing Costs vs Fuel Efficiency Savings | SQL, Python, Dash, Jupyter Notebooks (in-progress)</h3>
            <p>A ferry operator wanted to weigh the costs of regular cleaning and servicing against the improved fuel efficiency. <a href="https://link-to-live-project.com">Live Demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/your-repo/project-2">GitHub Repo</a></p>
