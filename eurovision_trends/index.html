        <p>I started nerding-out over the history and influences of Eurovision results and wanted to see if I could build some cool visualisations of trends or even predictions of what factors contribute to placing in the top 5 overall positions. I was particularly interested in the relationship (if any) between the professional jury vs general population scores. I used SQL and Python for data management and querying and Tableau to build the visual story.</p>
